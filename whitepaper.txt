RISK MODEL (sketch)

1) Introduction to the problem: estimation of correlations between different coins; direct computation of correlation from daily log-returns ranging from Jan 2018 until now; a few heatmap plots (different periods of time).

2) Issues: naive correlation might pick up 'fake clusters', sensitive to missing data and outliers, overall hard to interpret; more robust solution is MFM, explain here.

3) Implementation: choice of coin universe, choice of factors (returns std, strength, high-low, log marketcap, turnover), time horizon (Jan 2018 till now); a few words on normalization (scale factors to mean=0 std=1), data cleaning (returns, volumes ok, coin supply weekly updates).

4) Model: description of WLS (errors independent of X and of each other, non-constant variance), estimate var(errors)=var(y); discuss some diagnostic (error vs y_hat, error vs X,...);
present statsmodels.summary() tables, discuss accuracy.

*** Main problems: 
1) coin universe has 33 coins, we use 5 factors, is this 5/33 good proportion? 

2) the only reason why we update weekly is that I get the amount of coins in circulation by scraping coinmarketcap historical charts (not even sure this procedure is ok...). It would be better to find timeseries of daily coin supply data for 2018. This way we could update daily and model might gain accuracy.
