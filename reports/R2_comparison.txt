Comparison of R^2 for different types of regression, mainly to distinguish between OLS (oridnary least squares) and WLS (weighted least squares).

The weights used are defined as:
*weight(coin,time)= var(returns(coin))^{-1}
*with returns computed from some time_0 up to time.

In the OLS model, we minimize for each time: sum_c ||R_c-beta.factors_c||^2.
In the WLS model, we minimize sum_c ( W_c.||R_c-beta.factors_c|| )^2.
In particular, WLS is equivalent to OLS after rescaling R_c and factors_c by W_c.

There are six regressions, differing by definition of factor loadings and by OLS/WLS.
1) 'barra': OLS, Factor loadings as defined in Barra.
2) 'mine_std': OLS, Factor loadings differing from Barra in that they are averaged in time.
3) 'mine': OLS, Factor loadings as in 'mine_std', plus variance is replacing standard deviation.
4) 'barra_wt': WLS, same factors as 'barra'
5) 'mine_std_wt': WLS, same factors as 'mine_std'
6) 'mine_wt': WLS, same factors as 'mine'
